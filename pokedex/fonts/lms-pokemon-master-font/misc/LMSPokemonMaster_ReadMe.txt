my be available for downloading from a website.  Please let me know if
you are including my fonts on a download page.

There are three fonts in this font family.  Poke'mon Master Solid,
Poke'mon Master Outline and Poke'mon Master Dingbats.  In all of these
fonts the same Poke'mon appear on each letter.  Where I was able I used
original pokemon as the lowercase letters and one of their evolutions
on the uppercase letter.  Also where able one of these poke'mons name
begins with the letter it is attached to.  The Poke'mon in this font
are as follows:

0=Cuebone		1=Clafairy		2=Dratini
3=Electrode		4=Geodude		5=Krabby
6=Magikarp		7=Mankey		8=Pidgey
9=Staryu		a=Abra			A=Alacazam
b=Caterpie		B=Butterfree		c=Charmander
C=Charizard		d=Diglet		D=Dugtrio
e=Ekans			E=Arbok			f=Spearow
F=Fearow		g=Gastly		G=Gengar
h=Horsea		H=Seadra		i=Bulbasaur
I=Ivysaur		j=Jigglypuff		J=Wigglytuff
k=Koffing		K=Weezing		L=Lickitung
l=Laprus		m=Mew			M=MewTwo
n=Nidoran (Female)	N=Nidoqueen		o=Oddish
O=Vileplume		p=Pikachu		P=Raichu
q=Meowth		Q=Persian		r=Rattata
R=Raticate		s=Squirtle		S=Blastoise
t=Tentacool		T=Tentacruel		u=Seel
U=Dewgong		v=Vulpix		V=Ninetails
w=Weedle		W=Beedrill		x=Psyduck
X=Golduck		y=Eevee			Y=Vaporeon
z=Zubat			Z=Golbat

I tried to pick the most popular Poke'mon, but with 150 in the original
game, I'm sure I missed someones favorite.

Poke'mon the name and the characters used are copyrighted by Nintendo.

the Poke'mon images found at www.pokemon.com in the "Poke'dex" section.

Please note that the spacing on these fonts are a little off.  Should I
be able to figure out how to fix this I will update with a Ver.2
version of this font.
